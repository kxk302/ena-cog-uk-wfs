# Preparing a history with download links

If using the *variation* script you do not have to handle the uploads of your
sequencing data yourself. All you need to do is upload simple text files with
download links for the data into a specially tagged history. The *variation*
script will  scan the history for you, parse the links, upload the data and
trigger variation analysis runs as the data becomes available.

To make this work you need to structure the history according to the
expectations of the script. Here's how to do that:

1. For each batch of samples you want to analyze prepare *one* text file with
   download links.
   
   - Links found in one file will be analyzed as one batch in one script run in Galaxy
   - There must be one link per line in the file
   - Links must follow the format:

     `<baseurl>/<sampleID>_[12].<file_extension>`

     for example,
     
     `ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR545/006/ERR5451836/ERR5451836_1.fastq.gz`
     
     specifies an ENA download link for the forward (`_1`) reads of a sample
     with ID `ERR5451836`.
     
   - The order of links in the file does not matter.
   
     You must, however, specify exactly one forward (`_1`) reads and one
     reverse (`_2`) reads file for each sample.

   - The sample ID portion of the link will be carried through the whole pipeline and will become the basename of every output file for that sample.

   - If links do not specify the transport protocol directly, like in the above example, you need to configure the protocol in the *variation* script's config file (see the scripts [Usage instructions](./manual.md))

2. Create a new history on your target Galaxy server

3. Upload your batch files with download links to the new history as a Galaxy *Collection*

   - Open the Galaxy Upload Manager (by clicking the Upload Data button on the top-right of the tool panel)

   - In the `Download from web or upload from disk` dialogue window, switch to the `Collection` tab and confirm that `Collection Type` is set to `List`
     
   - Select `Choose local files`
   
   - Select the files you want to upload
   
   - Press `Start`
   
   - Once the `Build` button gets enabled, click on it
   
   - In the ensuing dialog, enter a name for the collection

     **Important**: The name has to match the `metadata_collection_name` set in
     the *variation* script config file (see the scripts
     [Usage instructions](./manual.md))

     *Note*: By clicking on the individual dataset names in that same dialog
     you can edit these, too. These names will be treated as the batch
     identifiers in the analysis and will be propagated to the history names
     generated by the scripts.

   - Press `Create list`

4. To make the *variation* script aware of the history and start processing the download links in the collection, add its recognized tag to your history

   The history tag that the *variation* script will be looking for can be set
   in its configuration file under `metadata_history_tag`.

   Click on the `Edit history tags` icon below the history name in the history
   panel. This will reveal any existing tags (none in your case) of the history
   and a big tag icon. Click on the icon, start typing the name as it appears
   in the config file and confirm with the Enter key.

That's it! Upon the next run of the *variation* script it will pick up the
history and process the first unprocessed links dataset in any suitably named
collections. Then in each subsequent run it will work on the links in the next
dataset until all datasets are processed.

## Adding additional batches as they become available

Whenever you obtain sequencing data for additional samples you can add them
exactly as described above. You can either

- create a completely new history with a collection in it and add the expected
  history tag to it

- reuse your existing and tagged history and simply add new data as a new
  collection of datasets with download links

Remember that in either case all collections must use the same name as defined in the
*variation* script config file. What will differ between them are the
names/batch identifiers of the contained datasets.
